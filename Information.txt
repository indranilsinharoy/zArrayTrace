Visual Studio Project settings:
==============================
1. Console Application >> Build DLL & Empty Project
2. Add the existing files arrayTraceClient.h to the Header Files (under 
   Solutions Explorer), and arrayTraceClient.c to the Source Files. Also, 
3. Solutions Platform >> x64/Win32 & Release
4. Configuration Properties >> General >> Character Set >> Use Multi-Byte Character Set
5. Under C/C++ code generation >> Runtime Library select /MT option for static linking of dependencies in the DLL. This will ensure that the build DLLs have the required runtime dependencies and should run in all windows machines. 
6. Build.


Execution of Python file:
=========================

cd to the directory ...\ArrayTrace and execute
the following command from cmd prompt:

    python arrayTraceClient.py


Misc. notes
===========
1. Although, the project was created as a "console application", we can still
   see MessageBox(s) used in the original c functions if needed.
