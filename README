Experimental code in development for array ray tracing in Zemax from Python.

The code is completely experimental at this stage, and it is not even in
working state.



Roadmap
=======
1. Get the array ray tracing code working independent of PyZDDE.
2. Figure out how to integrate the code with PyZDDE, so that array ray 
   tracing may be performed for an existing lens in the Zemax DDE server
   setup using PyZDDE.
