Experimental code in development for array ray tracing in Zemax from Python.

The code is completely experimental at this stage at the moment. The essential
idea is to use ctypes to create an interface for array ray tracing from
the example code (zclient.c and ArrayDemo.c) provided by Zemax. 


Things that are currently working
=================================
1. Able to do array ray tracing (independent of PyZDDE). The output matches
   the output of the ArrayDemo.c example that comes with Zemax, using the 
   lens file Cooke 40 degree field.zmx. The output of ArrayDemo.c is in the
   file arrayDemoRef.txt. The output of the function 


Roadmap
=======
1. Improve the Python interface for calling array ray tracing.
2. Figure out how to integrate the code with PyZDDE, so that array ray 
   tracing may be performed for an existing lens in the Zemax DDE server
   setup using PyZDDE.
3. Build both 32 bit and 64 bit dlls and test on other machines.



Credits
=======
The following people deserves special credit (even if we don't end up using
this code). Ian sent me a working code for tracing large number of rays 
sometime back, which gave me some crucial ideas about the implementation. 
Julian, who was also successful in implementing array ray tracing using 
ctypes, communicated several ideas with me about the implementation.
